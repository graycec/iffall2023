<h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
<ol>
<li>My name is Grayce. I am a Communications Design major and am in my sophomore year at WashU.</li>
<li>I love coding but didn't like how the McKelvey courses didn't present many opportunities to be creative. I wanted to take this class to learn how design can be combined with computer science.</li>
<li>I took a Web Development class over the summer. It was really fun but only a two week long course so definitely still a beginner!</li>
<li>I hope to learn more Javascript in this class because I feel like that is both the most useful and the most difficult aspect of Web Development</li>
<li>I expect designing for the screen to be different because it will take a lot more effort to be accurate/precise.</li>
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/"><li>Spotify:</a> This is very effective design because the homepage is perfectly curated to your personal music taste. It takes less than a second to see your favorite song and start playing it.</li>
<a href="https://www.vogue.com/"><li>Vogue:</a> This website communicates information effectively on both its homepages and interior pages. It is easy to view current events and today's top stories/topics.</li>
<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox"><li>G-Mail:</a> I think G-Mail works really well in integrating your email with other parts of the Google Suite. It is easy to see events from an email and add it to my calendar from the same page.</li>

  <h1>JOY</h1>
  <h2>(Unspeakable)</h2>
  <h3>Pharrell Williams and the Voices of Fire</h3>
  <p class="bar">-</p>

<p>Joy, joy, joy, joy!<br>
Whoa, yeah<br>
Unspeakable speakable<br>
The meaning's unreachable<br>
I'll go where he leads me to<br>
More synonyms, I'm gon need a few<br>
<br>
Lately I've had a hard time ain't been satisfied when I testify<br>
Wanna make sure I'm sharp when I make the point of you<br>
When them blessings come through, I'm clear then<br>
And even more clear when you do it again<br>
They must understand the point of you<br>
<br>
The last word doesn't come from the doctor<br>
Who's the world that the doctor comes out of<br>
Just keep praying beyond the last hour<br>
Now you witness the procedure of power<br>
<br>
Mumbling to myself, must think I'm crazy<br>
But I'm humbling myself, and I'm giving praise<br>
Fumbling God in myself, they don't know what I'm saying<br>
If you're crumbling and need help, I know who can raise you<br>
<br>
Unspeakable speakable<br>
The meaning's unreachable<br>
I'll go where he leads me to<br>
More synonyms, I'm gon need a few<br>
Lately I've had a hard time ain't been satisfied when I testify<br>
Wanna make sure I'm sharp when I make the point of you<br>
When them blessings come through, I'm clear then<br>
And even more clear when you do it again<br>
They must understand the point of you<br>
<br>
Said I couldn't change that<br>
That's another life<br>
But I scrubbed like Ajax<br>
I stayed on my grind<br>
I was way way back now I'm front of line<br>
Was I s'posed to say that?<br>
Ain't tryin' to undermine<br>
<br>
Mumbling to myself, must think I'm crazy<br>
But I'm humbling myself, and I'm giving praise<br>
Fumbling God in myself, they don't know what I'm saying<br>
If you're crumbling and need help, I know who can raise you<br>
Unspeakable speakable<br>

They must understand the point of you<br>
<br>
Dark situations can make them much brighter, yeah yeah<br>
If your spirits way down He can make them much lighter, yeah<br>
You're just taking off you can go higher<br>
Now let the joyful water fill your eyes up<br>
<br>
Lately I've had a hard time ain't been satisfied when I testify<br>

<li>My name is Grayce. I am a Communications Design major and am in my sophomore year at WashU.</li>
<li>I love coding but didn't like how the McKelvey courses didn't present many opportunities to be creative. I wanted to take this class to learn how design can be combined with computer science.</li>
<li>I took a Web Development class over the summer. It was really fun but only a two week long course so definitely still a beginner!</li>
<li>I hope to learn more Javascript in this class because I feel like that is both the most useful and the most difficult aspect of Web Development</li>
<li>I expect designing for the screen to be different because it will take a lot more effort to be accurate/precise.</li>
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/"><li>Spotify: This is very effective design because the homepage is perfectly curated to your personal music taste. It takes less than a second to see your favorite song and start playing it.</li></a>
